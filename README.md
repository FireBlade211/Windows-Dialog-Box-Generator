# Installation
Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/FireBlade211/Windows-Dialog-Box-Generator/releases) page, download the latest ZIP file, extract it, and run the executable inside.
You may wonder why there are 2 zip files available for download:
- Self-contained contains the .NET 8.0 runtime, so you don't need to have it installed to be able to run the app.
- Framework does not contain the .NET 8.0 runtime, so you need to have it installed on your system to use it.
